[CryptoPals](https://cryptopals.com/) is a collection of challenges that demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto. The challenge allows to craft the attacks in any language of choice. I chose Rust to simultaneously get used to the syntax of the language :).

Find some the writings on the challenge here: [CryptoPals Crypto Challenges Using Rust](https://dev.to/nvn/series/16087).
